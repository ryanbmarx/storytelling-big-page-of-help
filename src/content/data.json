If you don&#39;t have a filter, experts recommend you turn on the cold water and let it run for a minimum of two minutes before you use it.

Wash your child&#39;s hands before they eat, especially if they&#39;ve been playing outside in soil. </p>\n<p>Babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 3 years are at the highest risk for lead exposure, given their increasing mobility and tendency to put everything in their mouths. They also are rapidly developing their motor skills and mental capabilities. </p>\n<p>Homes built before 1970 have the highest risk of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated soil; you can search city of Milwaukee records to see when your residence was built.</p>\n",

Once a voter enters their name and date of birth, their voter status and current address pop up. </p>\n<p>The tracker shows six rectangles, which display the steps in the absentee process. Blue boxes signify that a step has been completed — so a row of completely blue boxes means the absentee ballot was received successfully. </p>\n",
